        <h1>Welcome to Awesome TOS</h1>
        <p>We simply make the TOS and similar boring documents readable to humans. 
           ATOS can be used as a widget to any website to display their TOS/Privacy Policy/Other legal documents
           to the end user and make sure the user read them.
           Only dependency is that the required site have to be added to <a href="https://tosdr.org/" target="_blank">tosdr</a> where
           we obtain the terms in shortened form.
           Please follow the Demos to understand how it works.

    				<img src="https://tosdr.org/img/tosdr-icon-64.png" />
    				<h4>1 : Taking the gist of each term</h4>
    				<p align="justify">First we strip down the loong boring TOS into small fragmented points. 
    				   In our case study, we found that the organization <a href="https://tosdr.org/" target="_blank">tosdr</a>
    				   has already done that. Better more, it also has a public API :) So we get the required terms of each site from
    				   their API.
    				</p>

    			<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4" style="text-align:center">
    				<img src="/img/good.png" width="64px" />
    				<h4>2 : Mixing interactive media</h4>
    				<p align="justify">
    				But the terms itself are still boring, so we add a little twist to make it more interesting.
    				We add custom designed icons to descrive each term. Please note that an initiative called 
    				<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Privacy_Icons" target="_blank">Mozilla Privacy Icons</a>
    				is already working on this. But since it's still in alpha state, we produced very few our own
    				icons. (Only 4 for now and another 4 in general). But still those add much color to the terms.

    				<img src="/img/voice.png" height="64px" />
    				<h4>3 : Adding voice based confirmation</h4>
    				<p align="justify">
    				All aboard, we still had one little issue. How can we make sure that the user is certainly
    				gonna read what's there? We can only force the user to go through the terms, not read them.
    				WAIT! we actually can make the user read them ;) We went a step ahead and add speech recognition
    				to see whether the user specifically say "I Agree" on each term. While this is working approach,
    				due to the amount of things that can go wrong in a voice based approach we have limited this as
    				only an added feature that is not mandatory unless specified by the caller.

    	    <h2>Intergrating ATOS with a custom registration form</h2>	
    	    
    	    <p>
    	    	ATOS is simply a widget. So any website can use it to display their agreement in human form :) But there's one little
    	    	requirement. That's you have to add that agreement to <a href="https://tosdr.org/" target="_blank">tosdr</a> first.
    	    	(Check <a href="#">Why We dont maintain our own terms database</a> for more info).
    	    	<br><br>
    	    	Once that's done, you can simply call the widget by the following javascript code

    	    	<div class="code col-xs-12">
    	    		var win = window.open("http://manzzup.koding.io:3000/generate?n=facebook&callback=callBack&voiceMode=1","View Agreement","width=500,height=500");

    	    		<br>
    	    		</li>
    	    		<li>
    	    		<b> callback </b> : This takes the local javascript function that should be called when the user is 
    	    				   finished reading the agreement. It's a callback function.

    	    		</li>

    		<h2>FAQ and stuff</h2>
    		
    		<ul>
    			<li>
    				<h3>Where do we get the prettified terms?</h3>
    				<p>We get it from <a href="https://tosdr.org/" target="_blank">tosdr</a>. tosdr is an open source project
    				and all data are licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License
    				(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0-standalone.html">AGPL-3.0</a>).
    				</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h3>Why dont we have our own pretty terms database?</h3>
    				<p>Simply because we dont want to reinvent the wheel. Above movement is already started
    				by a good community and has a rapid development. We would like to support it and base on it
    				rather than trying to be in competition with it.
    				</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h3>Where do we get the nice icons?</h3>
    				<p>We made most of the icons with much effort (really it was so damn hard :|).
    				But we also rob the ideas from the 
    				<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Privacy_Icons" target="_blank">Mozilla Privacy Icons</a> which
    				again is an Open Source initiative that we have high hopes for to being out a reliable and standardized 
    				set of privacy icons.
    				</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h3>Can't I show the ATOS widget without adding the terms to tosdr site?</h3>
    				<p>You CAN! The ATOS viewer widget is made to work completly seperate from it datasource. But it should be 
    				supplied with the correct format of data. This feature would be implemented in near future. Or if time permitted
    				within the scope of the hackathon itself :D
    				</p>
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				<h3>Where from here?</h3>
    				<p>
    				We belive that a few addition from here would actually lead this project to a worthy cause.
    				<ol>
    					<li>Standardizing the tosdr database and making it mandatory for websites to submit their legal 
    					documents to it</li>
    					<li>Releasing a standard set of Privacy Icons correspoding to most common terms/points in use</li>
    					<li>Incorporating the 'icon' feature to the 'points' schema of tosdr so that their API would be 
    					providing a rich and complete feature set</li>
    				</ol>
