Awesome TOS
============

We simply make the TOS and similar boring documents readable to humans. ATOS can be used as a widget to any website to display their TOS/Privacy Policy/Other legal documents to the end user and make sure the user read them. Only dependency is that the required site have to be added to tosdr where we obtain the terms in shortened form. Please follow the Demos to understand how it works.

ATOS is:

1.  Built on Meteor
2.  A widget that shows the traditional legal documents in an attractive way
3.  Allowing voice recognition to navigate through the legal document
4.  Mobile Ready!
5.  Build on open source initiatives : tosdr and Mozilla Privacy Icons
